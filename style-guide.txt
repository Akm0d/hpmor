=== Chapter headings ===

Chapters that aren't part of a continuing series look like this:

\chapter{The Fundamental Attribution Error}

Chapters that are part of a continuing series look like one of these:

\partchapter{Working in Groups}{I}

\namedpartchapter{Self-Actualization}{SA}{VIII}{The Sacred and the Mundane}

The first is pretty simple; it's just the title of the chapter
followed by which part it is.

The second looks like the title of the chapter, then the abbreviation
for the title of the chapter, then the part, then the title of the
part.


=== First sentences ===

Normally, a chapter starts like this:

\lettrine{P}{adma} Patil had finished

That creates the large initial letter.

If the first paragraph of the chapter is all italics, though, it looks
like this:

\begin{em}\lettrine{T}{he} red jet of fire took Hannah full in the
[...]
blazing green spirals brought down their foeâ€™s Shield Charm.\par\end{em}


=== Sections ===

\Section{Final Aftermath:}


=== Disclaimers and Epigraphs ===

These have been removed to an appendix.


=== Misc === 

There are some other things relating to newspaper headlines and such;
check the original versions of the chapters they appear in for the
appropriate markup.

The conversion tool has marked a number of weird paragraphs with:

*** FIXME: ***

I think they're all related to text that is centered in the original,
and probably requires an appropriate style to be applied in the
TeX. Check the original TeX for hints on what to do for new chapters.

The original maintainer has use \shout{} for emphasis when all-caps
text appears in the original, but I'm not sure this is appropriate
within spoken dialog, for example. I might try bolding them with
\textbf{} or underlining with \underline{}, and changing their case
back to lower. See what looks good.


=== HACKS ===

These are macros defined in hp-hacks.tex

\begin{writtenNote}
\letterAddress{Dear Me,}

Please play the game. You can only play the game once in a
lifetime. This is an irreplaceable opportunity.

Recognition code 927, I am a potato.

\letterClosing[Yours,]{You.}
\end{writtenNote}


\shout{Foo} - small caps
\scream{Foo} - make uppercase
\abbrev{FOO} - makes lowercase and then small-caps?

\headline{Foo Bar Baz} -  centers and small-caps
\inlineheadline{Foo Bar Baz} - just small caps again

\prophecy{foo} - an alias for \shout{}, currently.
